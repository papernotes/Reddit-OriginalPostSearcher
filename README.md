# Reddit Original Post Searcher Bot
[OriginalPostSearcher](https://www.reddit.com/user/OriginalPostSearcher/)  
A Reddit bot that aims to comment with the original submission of an xpost  

Made as a practice bot with Python for [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/). I wanted to make something for fun to learn a bit more about Python and databases.  
Thanks to [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), [/r/learnpython](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython), and [/r/python](http://www.reddit.com/r/python)

The format for a response is:
```
XPost from (subreddit with link)  
(submission title with link)
```
